# Opus Domi
This is for all your homework needs! All you have to do is input the homework questions and bam we'll give the answers (right now it only works for math)

# Technical stuff, only for programmers :
The plan is for a simple parser to deal with math, it will run on parse, however, english, is a bit more difficult as to even start we'll have to parse an entire actual language which, is a little difficult... But we'll try !
So , the way the parser works , is A we have a scope for brackets and stuff and B we have tokens, each one has a specific type like PLUS , MINUS, or DIVIDE etc.. And those will be run one at a time in the order of BEDMAS, if there are things like intergrals well sorry at the moment that wont be possible but will be soon.
